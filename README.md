# WEB-SCRAPPING-USING-PYTHON

This project demonstrates the process of web scraping data from a public website using Python's requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. The specific goal is to extract a table from a Wikipedia page and convert it into a structured pandas DataFrame for further analysis or manipulation.

Key Functionalities:

Fetches the HTML content of the target Wikipedia page using requests.get.
Parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup to locate the desired table element.
Extracts the table data (rows and columns) using appropriate traversal methods.
Constructs a pandas DataFrame from the extracted data, ensuring proper data types and handling missing values.

Benefits

Automates the process of collecting data from web sources, potentially saving time and reducing manual effort.
Creates a structured DataFrame that allows for easy data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Enhances your Python programming skills in web scraping and data manipulation techniques.
